Links_extract - This file first extracts all the links from the FinanceDisclosure website link given to me, and creates a finance_links.csv file

Filing_data - This file creates or scrapes all the data related to filing tab on the website

CandidateData - This file scrapes the data from the main or first page mainly about the candidate

The chromedriver is a Selenium driver, which must be updated after some time according to your chrome updated version!

Note: For both the Filing_data and CandidateData, you must have the finance_links.csv file in the same directory so that the code reads and gets the links accordingly for the data extraction
